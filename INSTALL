The following perl modules are needed:

Net::Whois::RIPE >= 1.23	# libnet-whois-ripe-perl
YAML				# libyaml-perl
Cache::FileCache		# libcache-cache-perl
Net::IP				# libnet-ip-perl
Template			# libtemplate-perl

If you are installing Net::Whois::RIPE then you should patch it with the
whois.diff file or it will not be able to parse some objects.
(The Debian package has already been patched.)

To install the package, unpack it in /usr/local/lib/, /opt/ or another
appropriate directory and then create symlinks to the programs from a
directory in the $PATH.


The point of the supplied template files is not to provide fully
generic and parametrized templates which can be used for every
router in every company, but to show some examples of template which
after some customization may be used for a class of routers in a company.

The mambo and hula example configuration files are a subset of real
configuration files which are being used in production.
