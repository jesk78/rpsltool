The following perl modules are needed:

Net::Whois::RIPE >= 1.22.1 # libnet-whois-ripe-perl
YAML                       # libyaml-perl
Cache::FileCache           # libcache-cache-perl
Net::IP                    # libnet-ip-perl
Template                   # libtemplate-perl

If you are installing a version of Net::Whois::RIPE <= 1.22 then you
MUST patch it with the NWR6.diff file.
(The Debian package has already been patched.)

The rpsltool program must be installed in a directory in the $PATH.

The YAML config files can be run as scripts, and will print the generated
configuration on stdout.
See www.yaml.org for details about the YAML syntax.

The point of the supplied templates file is not to provide fully
generic and parametrized templates which can be used for every
router in every company, but to show some examples of template which
after some customization may be used for a class of routers in a company.

The mambo and hula example configuration files are an edited subset of
real configuration files which have been used in production.
