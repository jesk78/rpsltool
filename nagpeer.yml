notes:
 "2001:7F8:B:100:1D1:A5D0:4589:7": "Publishes the AS-EASYNET6 as-set, but the routes from their japanese peers are not in the IRR anyway so I am not using it."
 217.29.66.12: "Mostly deaggregation by AS5397."
 217.29.66.17: "Actually all ASN are registered in RADB, but my configuration uses only the RIPE IRR and misses the expansion of one as-set."
 217.29.66.24: "Registered with an old origin and never updated."
 217.29.66.4:  "193.108.186.0/24 and 193.193.183.0/24 are the routes of a former customer which left months (years?) ago and now are learnt at MIX-IT and then leaked. Has an history of similar leaks."
 217.29.66.58: "A /23 announced deaggregated."
 217.29.66.68: "Has a few long-standing leaks."
 217.29.66.69: "Has a few long-standing leaks."
 217.29.66.7:  "Actually all routes are registered in RADB, but my configuration uses only the RIPE IRR."
