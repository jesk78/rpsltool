1.5
Added complete examples for building BIRD and OpenBGPd route servers for
an internet exchange.
Fixed the prefix^len, prefix^+ and prefix- cases of the route2cisco VMethod.
Added a route2bird VMethod to convert prefixes to the BIRD format.
Added list versions of all the route2* scalar VMethods.
Improved the ipsort VMethod to sort all v4 addresses before v6 addresses.
Stopped ignoring all template lines starting with "#" and only remove the
initial shebang line, if present.
Switched from YAML to YAML::XS.

1.4
Removed support for the asdot format in database objects, which conveniently
fixes support for asplain format in database objects.
Added a route2stdacl scalar pseudomethod like route2acl but for standard
ACLs. Fixed the ACL examples in the templates.
Fixed the aggregate() function to also aggregate overlapping networks.
Fixed the unimport directive to understand as-sets too.
Updated the default template with cleaner code and cool features.

1.3
Added support for ASN32: each ASN32 returned by RPSL expansion will be
replaced by AS23456 (AS_TRANS) unless the neighbor level boolean variable
asn32_supported is set (either at neighbor level or at the global level
as a default).
Added a "dotescape" Template::Toolkit list vmethod intended to be used as
syntactic sugar to escape the dots in regexps for ASN32 lists.
rpsltool: fixed the logic of the unimport and global_unimport directives,
which was reversed in 1.2.

1.2
Added neighbor level variables "localpref" and "metric", inheritable from
neighbor templates.
cisco-full.tt2: modified to use the "localpref" and "metric" per-neighbor
variables instead of the generic global variables.
cisco-full.tt2: fixed typos in the multicast route-maps.
cisco-full.tt2: renamed the peer-groups.

1.1
Added the route2acl scalar pseudomethod which converts a prefix in a
network/netmask pair separated by a space, to be used in IOS ACLs.
cisco-full.tt2: added some example code which uses route2acl to generate
uRPF ACLs.
cisco-full.tt2: do not set the peer-group in each AFI because it is not
needed by recent IOS releases and confuses some like 12.2(28)SB.
cisco-full.tt2: fixed some bugs in unusual configurations.
nagpeer: accept absolute paths for the template files.
nagpeer.*mail.tt2: correctly use "aut-num" or "as-set" in the text.
nagpeer: added support to add per-peer notes in the HTML report.

1.0
Modularized and cleaned up the code.
Added the routesdiff program (formerly part of my cisco-tools package),
to show which routes are actually not being accepted from a peer.
Added the testpeerfilter program, to test the effect of a filter on a
peer without actually loading it on the router.
Added the nagpeer program, to automatically generate reports of bugs in
the RPSL objects published by a peer.
Added the rpslexpand, to quickly perform RPSL expansion from the
command line.
Added the findextraobjs program, useful to identify obsolete entries in
peers configuration files.
Added documentation.
Use FindBin, which allows installing the modules in any directory.
Removed the aspath_acl_num parameter and the feature to automatically
assign the numbers to the as-path lists, which was implemented badly
and is probably not useful anyway without a persistent database.
Removed the support for specifying a template name on the rpsltool
command line after the configuration file name and for guessing the
template name from the config file name.
Added to rpsltool an explicit section with the default configuration
parameters, added more configuration parameters.
Added to the examples directory a proof of concept YAML schema file.
Hugely optimized Net::IP::rpsl_filter for the common case.

0.2
Minor updates to the example filters.
Added the print_routes example script.
