1.0
Modularized and cleaned up the code.
Added the routesdiff program (formerly part of my cisco-tools package),
to show which routes are actually not being accepted from a peer.
Added the testpeerfilter program, to test the effect of a filter on a
peer without actually loading it on the router.
Added the nagpeer program, to automatically generate reports of bugs in
the RPSL objects published by a peer.
Added the rpslexpand, to quickly perform RPSL expansion from the
command line.
Added the findextraobjs program, useful to identify obsolete entries in
peers configuration files.
Added documentation.
Use FindBin, which allows installing the modules in any directory.
Removed the aspath_acl_num parameter and the feature to automatically
assign the numbers to the as-path lists, which was implemented badly
and is probably not useful anyway without a persistent database.
Removed the support for specifying a template name on the rpsltool
command line after the configuration file name and for guessing the
template name from the config file name.
Added to rpsltool an explicit section with the default configuration
parameters, added more configuration parameters.
Added to the examples directory a proof of concept YAML schema file.
Hugely optimized Net::IP::rpsl_filter for the common case.

0.2
Minor updates to the example filters.
Added the print_routes example script.
