rpsltool
~~~~~~~~
Add support for the -s query flag, to get records from the RADB database
mirrored on the RIPE server. The syntax will be "SOURCE#OBJECT" (or not?).

What else would you like to see implemented?


testpeerfilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remove the embedded configuration section.


findextraobjs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implement less cryptic output.


general
~~~~~~~
Support for multicast AFIs has not been tested with most programs.

I do not like the aggregate() function and the pseudo-method using it.
