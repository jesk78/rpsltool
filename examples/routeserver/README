This is an extract of the configuration used at MINAP (http://www.minap.it/).

One common configuration file (minap) is used with two templates (*.tt2)
to generate three different configuration files: one for OpenBGPd by
changing the "template" parameter and one for the IPv6 BIRD instance
(which uses the same template of the IPv4 one) by changing the "ipv6"
template variable.
